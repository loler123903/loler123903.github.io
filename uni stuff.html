           Decision Advantage AI Hackathon - Honourable Mention 
        </h2>
        <p>
            This hackathon focuses on exploring how AI can create a "Decision Advantage" for a real-world defence problem. 
            The mission brief given to us during the hackathon was how defence can leverage AI and Autonomy for Decision Advantage. This was further broken up into three categories for us to focus on: planning, operations and training.  
            
        </p>
        <p>
            Our group decided to focus on the planning aspect of Decision Advantage by coming up with a system that would use AI to automatically classify EMS signatures using antennas put on fibre optic drones in order to map out possible threats in an area.
        </p>
        <p>
            The hackathon was a great oppurtunity to work together with others in order to solve a bigger problem and I would absolutely participate more in these types of events.

        <h2>Interactive Media Projects</h2>
        <p>
            These are just a small collection of coding projects that I did as part of the Interactive Media elective subject.
            The GUI and image processing projects was part of homework while the particle box project was part of the final project assignment for the subject.
